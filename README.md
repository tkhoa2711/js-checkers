[![CI Status](https://github.com/tkhoa2711/js-checkers/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tkhoa2711/js-checkers/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A very rudimentary implementation of the [Checkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_draughts)
game in JS

## Installation

You'll need:
- node
- yarn

Install all dependencies with:

```sh
yarn
```

If you don't have `yarn`, `npm` would work just fine. Just replace the commands
with `npm` instead of `yarn`.

## Run tests

```sh
yarn test
```
